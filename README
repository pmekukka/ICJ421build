ICJ421build
===========

Script to set up env. and build ICJ421 (https://github.com/IceColdJelly42/platform_manifest) in Arch Linux. Should work in other distros too except for the java part. XDA forum thread: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2052610

-Prompts for directory where you have run 'repo init' for ICJ421 repos
-Checks if the directory exists and is a repo dir
-Syncs with ICJ421 repos
-Asks if you want to 'make clean'
-Sources java6 (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sun-java6/)
-Checks that python2 is symlinked and not python3 and changes it if needed
-Starts to build
